# Development

### Link to Deployed Website
If you used the stencil code, this is `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/<name of your repository>`

### Goal and Value of the Application
This is an application very similar to the sample one given to us. It is a website for a bakery that lets customers look at the items offered online. Users can sort either alphabetically or by price (least to most) and can filter by the different types (bread, pastry or dessert) and the different sugar levels (low, medium or high) because sugar is a concern for a lot of Americans in terms of their diet preferences.

### Usability Principles Considered
- I made sure to organise the reading from the left to right to make it easier for the reader to read
- I've used different heading levels and font emphasises to differentiate between fonts and hierarchies
- I've also allowed the user to have a radio button to reset all the filters easily.
